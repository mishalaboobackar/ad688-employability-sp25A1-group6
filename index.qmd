## Introduction

The demand for data science, business analytics, and machine learning professionals has grown exponentially over the past decade. As organizations increasingly rely on data-driven decision making, understanding the current job market landscape is essential for career planning.

This project analyzes the 2024 job market using Lightcast data to answer key questions:

- What skills are most in-demand for Data Science, Business Analytics, and ML roles?
- Which industries are hiring the most data professionals?
- How do salaries vary by location, experience, and skill requirements?
- What is the career outlook for business analytics professionals?

## Research Rationale

The rise of artificial intelligence and automation has transformed the labor market. Data science and machine learning roles have emerged as some of the most sought-after positions across industries. Understanding which skills employers value, which regions offer the best opportunities, and how compensation varies can help job seekers make informed career decisions.

This analysis takes the perspective of a job seeker entering the data science field in 2024, examining real job posting data to identify trends and opportunities.

## Literature Review

Recent research highlights the evolving nature of data science careers. According to industry reports, Python, SQL, and machine learning frameworks remain the most requested technical skills in job postings. The demand for cloud computing expertise (AWS, Azure, GCP) has also increased significantly.

Studies show that salary disparities exist across geographic regions, with tech hubs like San Francisco, Seattle, and New York offering higher compensation. However, the rise of remote work has begun to equalize opportunities for candidates outside traditional tech centers.

Business analytics roles increasingly require a blend of technical skills and domain expertise, with employers seeking candidates who can translate data insights into actionable business recommendations.
